# hw_generator

I started this with the base code given.

I added the confirms for what characters were preferred in users password.

I added arrays with those options (upper/lowercase, special characters, numbers).

I added a prompt for the user to enter how many characters they preffered between 8-128.

I added one alert to show if user doesn't pick number of characters within limits of 8-128.

I worked really hard to try to get my final for loop to work correctly, but for loops are still escaping me at the moment.

Please be nice, this is only my second week of coding and I feel like my brain is melting.

Hope you are having a good day! <3
